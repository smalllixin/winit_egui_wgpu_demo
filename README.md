# Explain

This demo is for self test purpose. 

Reasons:

* My app need wgpu latest version, but egui is not publish to use latest version.
* Instead of use eframe because it is too much code depend on how eframe works. (Specially in rust world).

TODO:

winit has 0.30 released. And it has big breaking changes. To be honest I don't like it.
The old-school sdl2 offers more stable api. Maybe switching to sdl2 is a good choice.
